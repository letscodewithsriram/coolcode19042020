Issues: Source and Destination IP - From it got originated is hard to identify

Key Note: Netflow v5 - Will not support egress; It support only ingress

Steps:

1) Telnet - 
2) OSPF -

-w Align file rotation with next n minute ( specified by -t ) interval.  Example: If interval is 5 min, sync at 0,5,10... wall clock minutes Default: no alignment.

-D Daemon mode: fork to background and detach from terminal.  Nfcapd terminates on signal TERM, INT and HUP.

-B bufflen
          Specifies the socket input buffer length in bytes. For high volume traffic ( near GB traffic ) it is recommended to set this value as high as possible ( typically > 100k ),  otherwise  you risk to lose packets. The default is OS ( and kernel )  dependent.

-p portnum
          Specifies the port number to listen. Default port is 9995

-l base_directory 
Specifies  the  base directory to store the output files.

If a sub hierarchy is specified with 

-S the final directory is concatenated to base_directory/sub_hierarchy. This is for compatibility with nfdump 1.5.x and used to specify a single netflow source.

-S <num>
          Allows  to specify an additional directory sub hierarchy to store the data files. The default is 0, no sub hierarchy, which means the files go directly in the base directory (-l). The base
          directory (-l) is concatenated with the specified sub hierarchy format to form the final data directory.  The following hierarchies are defined:
            0 default     no hierarchy levels
